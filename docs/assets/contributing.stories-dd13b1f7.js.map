This is a quick method to run and debug code, but it will only work in modern browsers since it does not include transpilation.\\n\\nFor debugging older browsers, the demo can be run against transpiled source code via `npm run start:prod`.\\n\\nThe demo page will render the `examples/` for each component. To selectively include certain examples for debugging, add `.only` to their folder names.\\n\\n### Tests\\n\\nExecute `npm test` to run all tests and generate coverage reports at `./coverage/index.html`.\\n\\nMost of our server tests use `mocha-snap` in order to verify html snapshots against the generated html that the current component outputs. If these change the test will fail. In order to update the snapshots, one needs to run `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 npm test` and then new snapshots will be genrated, which should be checked in.\\n\\n### Marko Lifecycle Functions\\n\\nBecause eBayUI components are written in Marko, the component files may contain many of the Marko lifecycle functions. Within a given component's `index.js` file you will find the lifecycle functions intermixed with the component functions. Documentation on these functions can be found in the [Marko documentation on lifecycle events](http://v3.markojs.com/docs/marko-widgets/component-lifecycle/).\\n\\n### Package Scripts\\n\\nExecute `npm run`, or check the \\\"scripts\\\" section of `package.json` to view all available utility scripts.\\n\\nPlease ensure all scripts in `package.json` are Unix _and_ Windows friendly.\\n\\n### Continuous Integration (CI)\\n\\nTo ensure that all components function correctly in both Marko v3 and v4, we run our entire test suite against both versions. This requires automated installation of Marko versions, and is best executed in the CI (to avoid conflicting with local environments). The CI runs a specific `build:ci` task in the NPM scripts for this purpose.\\n\\nBy default when in the CI all browser tests will be ran against the supported list of browsers using [BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com). If you would like to manually test with your own BrowserStack account you can do so by adding a `.env` file to the root of this project with the following environment variables:\\n\\n```bash\\nBUILD_NUMBER=\\\"local\\\"\\nREPO_SLUG=\\\"ebay/ebayui-core\\\"\\nBROWSERSTACK_USER=\\\"YOUR BROWSERSTACK USERNAME\\\"\\nBROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=\\\"YOUR BROWSERSTACK ACCESS KEY\\\"\\n```\\n\\nFinally run `npm run test:browserstack` to begin the tests.\\n\\n## Pull Requests\\n\\nThis section contains information and etiquette regarding pull requests (or \\\"PRs\\\" as they are often called).\\n\\n### Before You Start\\n\\nIf you are creating a new component or significantly altering an existing one, please ensure that an issue has been created _before_ you start any work, and that it has been assigned to you. The same goes for any big new additions or changes to the project structure, CI or documentation.\\n\\nWe ask this because:\\n\\n-   we want to avoid cases where developers build something that does not align with our wants & needs\\n-   we want to be able to carefully plan our sprint and test cycles with minimal disruption\\n-   we want to avoid cases where two developers duplicate work\\n\\n### Writing Code\\n\\nThe contents of a pull request should be related to a single issue only (or, at most, perhaps two very closely related issues). The reviewer has the right to reject a pull request that contains anything non-issue related.\\n\\nWhilst it may be tempting to fix any [broken windows](https://www.rtuin.nl/2012/08/software-development-and-the-broken-windows-theory/) that you encounter, we ask you not to because:\\n\\n-   it can distract the reviewer from the main issue at hand\\n-   it can add additional time needed for the reviewer\\n-   it can increase the chance of regressions\\n-   it can make rollbacks more difficult\\n\\nSo please be a good citizen and create separate issues or pull requests for any broken windows that you find.\\n\\n### Moving Code\\n\\nPlease try and isolate \\\"noisy\\\" commits that only _move_ many files or lines of code, from commits that actually modify code logic. The reviewer has the right to reject a pull request that is difficult to reason with due to too much _unnecessary_ noise in the diff.\\n\\nFor example, assuming moving some code doesn't put the app into a broken state, the move can be considered a safe atomic commit (e.g. \\\"moved functions x, y and z to bottom of file\\\"). The actual _fixes_ to functions x, y and z can then be made in a follow up commit (e.g. \\\"fixed functions x, y and z\\\") which will be easier for the reviewer to diff.\\n\\n### Breaking Changes\\n\\nPlease think very carefully before introducing breaking API changes. Breaking changes may only be introduced in a major version. If you wish to alter the API _before_ a major version, then aliases can often be a good way to achieve this. Using an alias, the old API can be deprecated and will still continue to function.\\n\\n### Deprecating Code\\n\\nAny deprecated code should be clearly documented in the code comments and the release notes. Deprecated code will typically be scheduled for removal in the next major version.\\n\\n### Avoiding Conflicts\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your feature branch has no merge conflicts with its base branch. A pull request created and sent for review containing many conflicts does not inspire confidence in the reviewer.\\n\\nThe best way to ensure there are no conflicts is by keeping your branch up to date with its base branch and resolving any conflicts in your own branch early & often. If you are the only developer working in the feature branch, then it is usually better to rebase. If another developer is sharing your branch, then merging is the safer option (as it doesn't require a force push).\\n\\nIf you are working on a large feature, that takes many days, then there is a good chance that the base branch will have received other commits during that time. If you wait till the very end before syncing your branch with the base branch, then you may have to deal with some difficult merge conflicts.\\n\\n### Commit History\\n\\nWhilst having multiple \\\"work in progress\\\", \\\"almost done\\\" and \\\"merged branch\\\" type commits in a feature branch is fine, we wish to refrain from those commits polluting the milestone and master branch history. On the flip side, although rarer in comparison, we might also have some _atomic_ commits in our feature branch that we absolutely wish to keep as part of the project history.\\n\\nBefore creating your pull request you have two options regarding what to do with the commit history of your feature branch:\\n\\n1. Squash all superfluous commits. If more than 1 commit remains, then clearly label your PR as \\\"do not squash\\\" in order to keep this commit history. Any subsequent commits to the branch (i.e. those made after code review) may also need squashing by you.\\n1. Do not squash any commits and clearly mark your PR as \\\"must squash\\\" to indicate to the reviewer that you do not wish to keep any commit history. If you wish to keep any subsequent commits (i.e. after code review), you will now need to switch tracks to option 1 above.\\n\\nIf a pull request is received with a bewildering commit history that is difficult to reason with (e.g. 10+ commits containing obscure commit messages, previously committed code, old branch merges, etc), it will most likely be deemed too risky and therefore closed immediately.\\n\\n### Merging the Pull Request\\n\\nAn admin will merge or squash the pull request when it receives two approvals. Please try to avoid committing any more code at this point unless it is absolutely necessary, as this may invalidate the prior approvals (depending on branch settings).\\n\\nThe final commit message should include a reference to the pull request number. Commit descriptions are optional/rare and should be kept short. GitHub will by default annotate the description with a list of all commits in the pull request - this description is unnecessary and should be deleted.\\n\\n## Branching Strategy\\n\\nMembers of the eBayUI team must work in the main repository. Non-members must work in their own fork.\\n\\nDo not attempt to commit feature work directly to the master branch. Pushes to the master branch should only be used for important corrections to the documentation or website. The master branch **always** reflects the current production facing code.\\n\\nAll other branches are \\\"milestone\\\" branches or \\\"issue\\\" branches.\\n\\nEvery milestone branch must be created from the master branch. The branch name must match the milestone name, For example, when beginning work on the 2.9.0 release, a \\\"2.9.0\\\" milestone branch would be created from the master branch.\\n\\nWork for every issue must go in it's own branch. The branch name will match the issue number. For example, for issue number 202, a branch named \\\"202\\\" would be created. Remember: more than one developer may work in an issue branch, so please be courteous!\\n\\nIssue branches must be created from the relevant milestone branch. For example, if issue 202 will go out in the v2.6.7 milestone, then the 202 issue branch must be created from the 2.6.7 milestone branch. This helps to keep any rebasing sane.\\n\\n<strike>When work on an issue branch is complete and committed upstream, the Travis CI job must successfully run on that branch.</strike>\\n\\nWhen all milestone issues are complete, and merged into the milestone branch, an admin will either perform a pre-release, or they will merge the milestone branch into the master branch in preparation for a final release.\\n\\nA milestone branch will be deleted after it has been merged into master. There is no need to keep these milestone branches lying around, as we can go back to any point in time using git tags.\\n\\nWith this strategy, there are rarely more than a handful of branches at any one moment in time:\\n\\n-   master branch (reflects current production code/release)\\n-   next minor or major milestone branch\\n-   next patch milestone branch\\n-   _n_ number of feature/issue branches (usually 1 - 3)\\n\\n## Unit Tests\\n\\nEach component has two suites of unit tests: server-side tests & client-side tests.\\n\\nOur unit tests follow the \\\"black-box\\\" approach. We test only the exposed, public API. We do not explicitly test the internal, private methods. Private methods are considered to be tested _implicitly_ whenever we test part of the public API (which can be evidenced via code coverage reports).\\n\\nServer side testing is predominantly concerned with the testing of _rendering_. Given an input of a marko tag and it's attributes, we test that the rendered output matches our expected outcome.\\n\\nBrowser side testing is predominantly concerned with the testing of _state_. For this we follow the Given-When-Then approach (i.e. _given_ a component is in a well-defined state, _when_ a well-defined action is performed on it, _then_ we assert that it meets the expected outcome).\\n\\nFor both types of tests, please observe the following golden rules:\\n\\n-   A test should only test one thing\\n    -   Watch out for the words 'and' & 'or' in your test description!\\n-   A test should not contain conditional logic\\n    -   We don't want to have to write tests for our tests!\\n-   A test description should avoid interpolated strings\\n    -   Test descriptions should be human readable (readable != parsable)\\n\\nAbove all, all aspects of a test should be human readable. A simple litmus test for this is that anybody should be able to read the test and, within a few seconds, be able to tell you what the _purpose_ of the test is. If they are confused, or ask questions, then it is not a well written test. Go back and refactor!\\n\\n## Definition of Done\\n\\nA component is considered \\\"done\\\", and ready for merge into release branch, when the following 3 checkpoints have been satisfied:\\n\\n1. Foundational layer review\\n\\n-   Visual design (DS6)\\n-   Markup structure (Bones)\\n-   Accessibility pattern (MIND)\\n-   CSS (Skin)\\n\\n2. Component layer review\\n\\n-   Tag API\\n-   Event API\\n-   Unit tests\\n-   Integration test\\n-   Performance test\\n-   Documentation\\n\\n3. Code review\\n\\n-   Linter should catch syntax and style issues\\n-   Prefer performance over readability, but readability over \\\"space saving\\\" code\\n-   Apply the single-responsibility principle to functions\\n-   Refactor long functions into several small functions\\n-   Identify and move common utility functions to libraries or static methods\\n-   All CSS should come from Skin\\n\\n## Releases\\n\\n### Pre-Release\\n\\nAll major and minor releases should be preceded by one or more pre-releases. All pre-releases must be created from a `milestone` branch.\\n\\n1. Run `npm version prepatch`, `npm version preminor`, or `npm version premajor`. If you need to increment an existing prerelease use `npm version prerelease`. This command will automatically:\\n    - update the version number in `package.json`\\n    - commit all changes locally\\n    - create a Git tag\\n1. Run `git push` to push the commit to origin. (**Note**: do not push tags for prereleases.)\\n1. Run `npm publish --tag beta` to publish the package to NPM.\\n\\n### Final Release\\n\\nA final release is always made from the `master` branch.\\n\\n1. Create a GitHub PR to merge the milestone branch into master branch.\\n1. Merge the PR after approval (do not squash!)\\n1. Switch to your local master branch and pull the changes from origin.\\n1. Run `npm version patch`, `npm version minor`, or `npm version major`. This command will automatically:\\n    - update the version number in `package.json`\\n    - commit all changes locally\\n    - create a Git tag\\n1. Run `git push` to push the commit to origin.\\n1. Push the git tag to origin, e.g. run `git push origin v1.0.0` using the new version tag you just created.\\n1. Run `npm publish` to publish the package to NPM.\\n\\nAfter every major and minor release, please take the opportunity to upgrade any outdated dependencies and devDependencies (_hint_: run `npm outdated` to see outdated dependencies). Except for major version upgrades, the version in `package.json` should always reflect the last known working version, not the version you are upgrading to.\\n\"","import { Meta, Markdown } from \"@storybook/addon-docs\";\nimport contributing from \"../../../CONTRIBUTING.md?raw\";\n\n<Meta title=\"Contributing\" />\n\n<Markdown>{contributing}</Markdown>\n"],"names":["contributing","_createMdxContent","props","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","Markdown","MDXContent","MDXLayout","_provideComponents","__page","componentMeta","__namedExportsOrder"],"mappings":"2VAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ECMf,SAASC,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,OAAoBC,EAAAA,KAAMC,EAAAA,SAAW,CACnC,SAAU,CAAcC,EAAI,IAACC,EAAM,CACjC,MAAO,cACb,CAAK,EAAG;AAAA,EAAmBD,EAAI,IAACE,EAAU,CACpC,SAAUP,CAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASQ,EAAWN,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CACJ,QAASO,CACb,EAAM,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEC,EAAkB,EAAIR,EAAM,UAAU,EAC5D,OAAOO,EAAyBJ,EAAI,IAACI,EAAW,CAC9C,GAAGP,EACH,SAAuBG,EAAI,IAACJ,EAAmB,CAC7C,GAAGC,CACT,CAAK,CACL,CAAG,EAAID,EAAuB,CAC9B,CAEY,MAACU,EAAS,IAAM,CAC1B,MAAM,IAAI,MAAM,iBAAiB,CACnC,EACAA,EAAO,WAAa,CAClB,SAAU,EACZ,EACK,MAACC,EAAgB,CACpB,MAAO,eACP,KAAM,CAAC,aAAa,EACpB,eAAgB,CAAC,QAAQ,CAC3B,EACAA,EAAc,WAAaA,EAAc,YAAc,GACvDA,EAAc,WAAW,KAAO,CAC9B,GAAIA,EAAc,WAAW,MAAQ,GACrC,KAAMJ,CACR,EAC4B,MAAAK,EAAA,CAAA,QAAA"}
