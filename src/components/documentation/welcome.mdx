# eBayUI Core

> Collection of Marko widgets; considered to be the core building blocks for all eBay components, pages & apps.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Marko](https://markojs.com) (v4+)
- [eBay Skin](https://ebay.github.io/skin/) (v13+)

_Note: eBayUI Core components utilize Marko flags and, therefore, require `<lasso-page/>` to be added to any page which will have core components._

_Note: `@ebay/skin/global` and `@ebay/skin/marketsans` are required to be loaded by your app for all modules to load correctly._

_Note: In order for spread attributes to work properly, `marko@4.18.22` at least is required_

### Browser Policy

All components are developed and tested cross-browser using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/public-build/M1FCV3RrZHhkTG9ZaXBwWmY0VDJvZUhPM1cwM1RCZTBMRUVrODJ0MVg5Yz0tLTMyY0tGZHNKSGpTbk5DeFVURTNGNFE9PQ==--dd4c576f4331f72c56cb7f9a9f4ac4f403d34b0f), in accordance with our official [eBay Browser Policy](https://github.com/eBay/browserslist-config).

### Accessibility (A11Y)

We take accessibility very seriously. Very seriously indeed. Therefore, all components are built in accordance to the <a href="https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/">eBay MIND Patterns</a>. These patterns, in turn, build on from the specifications provided by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a>.

Components are built in a layered, progressively enhanced fashion, utilizing the following resources:

- <a href="https://github.com/ianmcburnie/bones">Bones (HTML)</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/eBay/skin">eBay Skin (CSS)</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/makeup-js">MakeupJS (JavaScript)</a>

Each layer does its bit to enforce and enhance accessibility. We consider this level of support to be one of our chief selling points, and we hope you do too!

## Releases &amp; Milestones
