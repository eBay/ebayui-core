## ebay-carousel Events

**Notes:**

* The carousel will use native scrolling if a sufficient implementation of the css scroll snapping api is available. Otherwise it will fall back to using a transform with manual user navigation via the controls.
* The `carousel` will manipulate the `tabindex` property of nested focusable elements inside `<@item>`.
* The `autoplay` carousel currently does not support native scrolling and will use transforms instead.
* The `items-per-slide` attribute can be set to a float such as `3.5` to show 3 items, and half of the 4th item. If `items-per-slide` are set as a whole number, it will automatically be set as a x.1 peek if carousel is not autoplay.
