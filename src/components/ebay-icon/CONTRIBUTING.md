## How To Add a New Icon
 1. First add the icon to the [DS4 or DS6 folders](https://github.com/eBay/skin/tree/master/src/svg) in [@ebay/skin](https://github.com/eBay/skin).
 2. Publish the changes in @ebay/skin and update the dependency in this repository.
 3. Run `node ./scripts/import-svg` from this project to import the icons into this repository.

Notes:

* All Icons are automatically added to `./src/components/ebay-icon/symbols` and this folder should not be touched.
